*You'll need to create a DigitalOcean account before you can make a droplet. There are options for the standard middle ground, high memory usage, and high CPU usage. The prices for droplet sizes range from $5/mo to $1280/mo.*

1. Select "Create Droplet", then under "Choose an image" select "one-click apps" and choose Wordpress 4.8 on 16.04. For provisioning when using the Roots method, select Ubuntu 16.04.2 x64 on "Distribution".
2. Choose a size plan based on your needs.
3. Choose a datacenter region. It is recommended you choose one in the United States; the number doesn't matter.
4. Set the name of your droplet. DO NOT use spaces or non-alphanumeric characters.
5. Click CREATE and wait for DigitalOcean to fire it up.

- Optional: Add an SSH key between steps 3 and 4. See [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-digitalocean-droplets) on how to create one and get into the server.
